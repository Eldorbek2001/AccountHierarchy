	//Allows deposits and withdrawals, except SafeAccount objects have a $1000.00 credit line meaning withdrawals can go up to $1000.00 over the balance. The loan amount must be maintained and accessible to programmers. Any deposit amount first goes towards loan amount. Additional funds can then go to the balance. A SafeAccount object must also be able to tell you the loan amount.
